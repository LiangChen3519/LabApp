# LabApp
 Self-developed APP for scientific work
 
 # How to use 
 
 The way for using the small APP is really easy. First, you just put all *.tcf* into a folder, e.g. DOC. Then, run this APP, and click *Select* button, APP will auto detect all *.tcf* files, and merge them together as a dataframe. You can go through the merged dataframe in the center area (TableView) of the APP. At this moment, the indentations of rows might be looked wired. Further improvements could adjust the all laylouts of this APP. Finally, you can check the radiobutton to select the format of file you want to save, the default format is *.csv* foramt. you will find a new output file in the same path of the inputed folder. To avoid one situation which user forget to input the file name (name the file), the system date will be auto appended to the empty file name.
